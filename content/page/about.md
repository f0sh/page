My name is Florian and I am an former Information Security Consultant at Commerzbank in Frankfurt and a self-employed IT consultant.

On these pages you will find some information about me and my work. Furthermore, you will find my CV and contact details. You will also find some of my projects, which I initiated during my time as a student of business informatics at the Technical University in Darmstadt.

If you would like to receive more information from me, I would be happy to hear from you. Use the contact form to send me a message quickly and easily.

## Leisure activities

When I'm not working on technical projects, I spend most of my free time doing sports.

I am an [enthusiastic alpinist](http://alpenverein-darmstadt.de/ausbildung-touren/wanderungen/) , which is why I go on alpine tours at least once a year. In addition, I use every spare minute to explore the mountains in the Rhine-Main area, which are unfortunately only scattered around.

Furthermore, I am involved as a team leader in the [university group Enactus](../p/enactus), which implements social projects in an entrepreneurial way to create a perspective for people in difficult life situations.
