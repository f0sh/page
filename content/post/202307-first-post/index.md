My old website is from summer 2013 and celebrates its 10th anniversary this year. At that time, jquery was brand new and I tried it out. Since the site was static at first, but I wanted to create some posts dynamically, I used Dokuwiki in the backend. The rendered HTML pages were then injected into the site. PHP was running in the background for Dokuwiki, contact form and some scripts. But I think it was time to change some things here.
