## Classification of Banking

In general Banking systems can exist in two different forms:

- System of Universal Banks
- System of seperated Banks

**Universalbanks** unify Commercial Bank Services together with Investment Bank services. Therefore these kinds of banks can offer a complete portfolio of service out of one hand and share assets between different services. For example a corporate client can keep different foreign exchange accounts at a bank and ask to use the bank to also care about the risk management of these foreign currencies to balance out market movements. Therefore the business can be much more efficient. Usually these banks are found in the European market.

The **system of seperated banks** has its origin in the anglo-american market and devides Commercial Banking services from Investment Bank services by seperating them into different entities. Therefore a mix of assets is not possible anymore and clients need to keep relations with multiple company entities. The advantage of this concept is a highly specialized banks and therefore less risk exposure. 

Furthermore Banks can be broadly classified into three categories: Business Banks, Governmental Banks, and Shared Banks.

- **Business Banks** are single entities that offer a diverse product portfolio. They aim to unify profitable banking services and are usually shareholder-owned or private. The primary goal of Business Banks is to generate profits for their shareholders.<br><br>
- **Governmental Banks**, on the other hand, offer traditional banking products and are usually distributed. They centralize outsourcing of complex services and are government-owned. The primary goal of Governmental Banks is to provide banking services for the public.<br><br>
- **Shared Banks** cater to both private and business customers and aim to generate profits for communities. They offer traditional banking products that are usually distributed. Shared Banks centralize outsourcing of complex services and are member-owned. The primary goal of Shared Banks is to provide affordable banking services (credit) for their members.

Besides this, there are several more types of banks, which usually specialize in a field.

- **Real Estate Banks** offer financial service to establish and manage Real Estate, like financing big Real Estate projects and manage financial risks.<br><br>
- **Savings Banks** are more focused on private customers to help them save money for bigger investments in their lifes. Usually these includes buying or building property.<br><br>
- **Special Task Banks** have a certain mission they follow. Examples can be Development Banks, which have a governmental task to create financial inventives for defined investments under certain terms and conditions.
