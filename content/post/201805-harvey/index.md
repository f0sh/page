Harvey is a smart plant bed that enables automatic watering and lighting of the plant. The user receives information on the care and status of the system with the help of the smartphone app. The user can make all the settings via the app and also purchase add-ons and consumables for his plant. A Harvey connects to the WLAN available in the house and can thus be controlled remotely from anywhere.

The start-up Harvey was founded in 2017 by 5 students from the field of industrial engineering in a student seminar with Prof. Caroline Bock at the Technical University. The development was carried out entirely by the students themselves. It was supported by the HIGHEST Gr√ºndungszentrum in Darmstadt and the Hessen Ideen Stipendium of the University of Kassel.

During this time I have intensively dealt with the following topics

* Customer-oriented product development
* Creating a value proposition
* Developing a business model
* Developing circuit boards and programming microcontrollers for IoT
* have been busy.

The startup idea is currently paused due to lack of time of the team members.
